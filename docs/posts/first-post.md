Welcome! This is my first time writing a post directly on my new journal. If you're seeing this, I've just moved to VitePress and migrated all previous posts from [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev). Below this post are all the things I've posted before on other platforms.

VitePress is a static site generator that works by taking your content written in Markdown and applying a theme to it to generate static HTML pages. It allows you to customize its theme using Vue.js components and CSS, or build entirely new themes. It also has a collection of community-made themes that you can use, ready to go.
